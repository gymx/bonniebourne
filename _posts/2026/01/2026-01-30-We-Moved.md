# We've Moved

Not what you thing. We're still at Bonnie Bourne and currently freezing. Our propane tank decided to go from 50% to 6% overnight. Nope, it didn't leak. It just had a bad gauge. Still does. It's still almost empty. So empty that our furnace things it's empty so we're heating with the wood stove. That works great in the living room but everywhere else in thouse is a bit ... chilly.

### The SITE moved

You shouldn't notice or care, the same URL works to find us. The same Facebook and Instagram links are still working. I just moved the site from a hosted WordPress server to a github pages server. It's much less to maintain this way and MUCH cheaper for a bolg we, as you can see, update VERY infrequently.

### So there you go

The site has a new home and maybe we will post a bit more. There have been many, many updates around here we haven't posted about so we'll try to put some of those in writing/pictures to share them.
